=================Bugs List=======================================
1.) cann't refresh the Type automatically (Mar 21) 
done with the solution: add TypeEditPart as children models' listener (deprecated)
it's the bug of the eclipse. update to 3.2 no such issue.
1.0--Jun 23) calculate the compartmentfigure depending on the labelfigure.
done on Jun 23, refine on Jun 26
1.1) how can refresh the current created Type (Mar 21)
deprecated!
1.3) the length of the line above the compartment (Mar 21)
deprecated!
1.4) delete the label of the compartment (Mar 21)
deprecated!
1.5) add margin border for the member (Mar 21)
deprecated!
2.) there are some errors in the uti package (Mar 21)
changed by Micheal.
7.0--Jun 10) why first comes the description property then name property?
in one class the last added propertydescriptor appears first.
8.0--Jun 16) how to use bendpoint delete command?
11.0--Jun 13) the dirty key of the editor is broken.
11.0--Jun 13) by loading the umlModelPart should be refreshed.
done on 13 July. refresh the UmlModel by UmlEditor.initializeGraphicalViewer.
==============Questions (theoretical)===============================
1.0--July 2)There is a general problem to face when we use a parent contains children in GEF. 
In the case of UML class diagram, that is, the Class contains the Attributes/Methods. Of course 
we set ToolbarLayout as the ClassFigure's layout. The problem is which layout we should use as 
the layout of the container figure of the parent figure, in the case of Uml class diagram the 
UmlModelFigure is the container figure of the ClassFigure. When we set ToolbarLayout instead of 
XYLayout as UmlModelFigure's layout, also install ToolbarLayoutEditPolicy to UmlModelEditpart, 
we can solve two issues: 
	1) By initiating ClassFigure expands with filled child figures automatically. 
	2) When the child model(Attributes/Methods) is changed, the size of parent(Class) figure 
  		is changed automatically without manual refreshing of the class figure.
But normally we should use the ToolbarLayout(ClassFigure) and XYLayout(ContainerFigure of ClassFigures) 
together. 
What can we do now? add ParentPart as PropertyListener to the childmodel. I don't think this is a good idea, 
because usually the parent part is created before the creating of the child models.
2.0--July 4)what's the difference between the java.lang.Class object.newInstance and new constructor?
1) newInstance() needs the no params (default)constructor.
2) new constructor needs to know the name at the compiler time. 
3) I think, this involves the Java reflection/class loader. Each java class has one
java.lang.Class object at the runtime, because JVM uses ClassLoader to load it into the memory.
